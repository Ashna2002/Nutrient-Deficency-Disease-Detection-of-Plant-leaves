# Nutrient-Deficiency-Disease-Detection-of-Plant-leaves 🌿🌱🍃

This web application, developed with Streamlit, enables users to upload images and identify diseases or nutrient deficiencies in them. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on relevant data to generate predictions.

## Features
    * Upload images for analysis
    * Detect diseases or nutrient deficiencies from the uploaded images
    * User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit
    
## Model
The CNN model used for prediction is trained on a dataset of images containing examples of various diseases and nutrient deficiencies. The model has been trained to recognize patterns indicative of these conditions in images.
